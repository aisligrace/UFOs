# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
For this project, we used JavaScript, along with HTML, Boostrap, CSS,to build an interactive table where users can filter on different UFO sightings by city, state, country, shape, and date. We had previously created the 'date' filter but for this challenge, we expanded to include the other parameters.
