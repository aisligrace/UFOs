# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
For this project, we used JavaScript, along with HTML, Boostrap, CSS,to build a website with an interactive table where users can filter on different UFO sightings by city, state, country, shape, and date. We had previously created the 'date' filter but for this challenge, we expanded to include the other parameters.

## Results
The website we created is simple, clear, and user friendly. Users have multiple different search parameters they can use, including date, shape, city, and country.
