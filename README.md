# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview
For this project, we used JavaScript, along with HTML, Boostrap, CSS,to build a website with an interactive table where users can filter on different UFO sightings by city, state, country, shape, and date. We had previously created the 'date' filter but for this challenge, we expanded to include the other parameters.

## Results
The website we created is simple, clear, and user friendly. Users have multiple different search parameters they can use, including date, shape, city, and country.

## Summary
While this website is simple and user friendly, one difficulty is not knowing all the available options within each search parameter. For example, there isn't an easy way to know all the available shapes. One remedy to this would be to include a drop down menu of available shapes to choose from. Along with creating drop down menus, if I had more time, I would add a 'clear' or 'refresh' button to clear out the search boxes so the user could start from scratch. There is also not a way to search for comments, which makes sense because some of the comments are extremely long and detailed. With further development, you could add a 'Enter a Key Word(s) for Comments' search parameter, that could search for key words within the comments.
